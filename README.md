# WordPress Tweaks

When building a custom theme for a client site, you're likely to include functionality that 'cleans up' the code generated by WordPress, and the admin interface. The problem is, such functionality should be in a plugin, not a theme. This plugin is a collection of tweaks that you can use to extend your WordPress site.

## Usage

This plugin is meant for hacking! Dive into the code, and add or remove tweaks depending on your personal preferences, or the current project.

Install this plugin through Git:

    cd wp-content/plugins
    git clone https://github.com/bungeshea/wordpress-tweaks.git

Then, open up the plugin files and add, remove, or edit tweaks as you see fit.
